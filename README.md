# TLabWebViewVR-OculusIntegration-2022

## Overview
- Sample project for using TLabWebView with Oculus Integration
- This sample is the minimum configuration for using TLabWebView with the Oculus Integration.

## Note
- Android Custom Manifest Issue 1

	- Unity 2021.1.* recommended adding the following to the manifest file

```xml
<!-- For Unity-WebView -->
<application android:allowBackup="true"/>
<application android:supportsRtl="true"/>
<application android:hardwareAccelerated="true"/>
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"/>
	
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MICROPHONE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
	
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.microphone" />
<!-- For Unity-WebView -->
```
  
	- However, this is not recommended for Unity 2022.1.* and later. 
	Adding this caused a problem with the manifest file not being properly configured at build time.
	It is recommended not to add these items to Android Custom Manifest after Unity 2022.1.*. (Creating Custom Manifest itself is not a problem)
  
- Android Custom Manifest Issue 2

	- When specifying OpenXR as the XR plugin provider, a part of the manifest is forcibly deleted and an error occurs in WebView. Therefore, it is recommended to specify Oculus as the plugin provider.


```xml
<!-- Error: net::ERR_CACHE_MISS -->
<uses-permission android:name="ANDROID.PERMISSION.INTERNET"/> <!-- Missing !! -->
```


- The policy has been changed to manage libraries in the repository as submodules.

	- Commit ``` f26c332 ``` If you cloned the project before, please clone the repository again.
	- Use ``` git submodule update --init ``` to adjust the commit of the submodule to the version recommended by the project.
